having trouble running bundle install locally to generate my Gemfile.lock:

An error occurred while installing pg (1.5.8), and Bundler cannot continue.
Make sure that `gem install pg -v '1.5.8' --source 'https://rubygems.org/'` succeeds before
bundling.

In Gemfile:
  spina was resolved to 2.5.0, which depends on
    pg

was able to resoleve this by installing pg locally:
brew install libpq
brew install postgresql
brew link --force postgresql


ran into another issue where my mac was running bundler-1.17 so I ened up installing rbenv and getting a newer version of ruby/bundler

brew install rbenv
rbenv init
rbenv install 3.0.6 - m3 mac
rbenv global 3.0.6
gem install bundler

env error:
avabarron@Avas-MacBook-Pro ~/E/spina-app> ruby -v

avabarron@Avas-MacBook-Pro ~/E/spina-app> rbenv local 3.0.6

so updated shell:
set -gx PATH $HOME/.rbenv/shims $PATH
set -gx PATH /opt/homebrew/bin $PATH
avabarron@Avas-MacBook-Pro ~/E/spina-app> rbenv rehash
rbenv local 3.0.6

FINALLY able to run bundle install >.>
aaaand needed to downgrade to 2.5.15 for docker 
gem install bundler -v 2.5.15
rbenv rehash

trying docker-compose build again T_T

BRUH
WHY DO I HAVE TO INSTALL ALL THIS STUFF ON MY COMPUTER
 _I don't want all this_
LKDJFLSJLKSJDFKLSDF
ugh:
xcode-select --install
brew install cmake

downgrade sassc bc spina is old ash
gem 'sassc', '~> 2.2.1' 


was having issues with docker building gemfile 
9.948 An error occurred while installing sassc (2.2.1), and Bundler cannot continue.
9.948 
9.948 In Gemfile:
9.948   spina was resolved to 2.5.0, which depends on
9.948     sass-rails was resolved to 6.0.0, which depends on
9.948       sassc-rails was resolved to 2.1.2, which depends on
9.948         sassc
